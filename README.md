# Stator AFM (Visual Studies)

<a href="http://www.stator-afm.com">**Stator AFM**</a> is easy to use portfolio management software for traders and investors. Stator is highly analytical and comes with a free visualisation add-on allowing users to go nuts creating interesting visualisations of their financial, trading and investing data.

> The visual studies in this repository are compatible with add-on version 3.3.16230+

## Before we go on, explain what Stator is again?

To put this in simple terms, Stator is portfolio management software. Ever seen the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/">'Wall Street'</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/">'The Wolf of Wall Street'</a>? Well it's software that can be used by those individuals as well as any other, down-to-earth trader or investor. More than likely the people using Stator are more like you and I!

And yeah, I am the guy that wrote Stator so <i>send me some love if you don't mind</i>!

## <a name="what-visual"></a>So this visual studies functionality, why did you create it?

I wanted to give users of Stator as much flexibility as possible in analysing their data. With the evolution of HTML5 and javascript visualisation libraries it was only natural that someone (aka me) try and merge everything into desktop software. The end result is a free add-on that leverages HTML5 technology directly in the desktop environment.

Stator exposes data at various 'domains' within the software and users can write visualisations using any of the popular visualisation libraries available. At the current time visual studies supports the following libraries:

Those are the big boys of javascript visualisation libraries right there, from left to right they are:

Please note: <i>Visual studies functionality has been designed in such a way that supporting new libraries is a piece of cake. We've tried to make visual studies as future-proof as possible.</i>
